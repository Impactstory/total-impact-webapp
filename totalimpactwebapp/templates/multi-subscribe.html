   <p>Thanks for purchasing subscriptions to Impactstory!</p>
   <p>
      Here's the coupon code that you can distribute; it'll allow
      anyone who uses it to get a free profile subscription, and it's
      good for {{ num_subscriptions }} redemptions.
   </p>
   <pre>{{ coupon_code }}</pre>
   <p>
      It's easy to use. Whoever has the code just 
      <a href="http://impactstory.org/signup">signs up for Impactstory</a>, 
      then goes to settings (the gear icon in the top right corner) and 
      clicks "subscribe." They should select "annual subscription" and then,
      instead of entering their credit card,
      they can just enter your coupon code. That's it!
   </p>
   <p>
      After their subscription is set up, folks can        
      fill out their profile as normal; this takes 5-30 minutes, depending
      on how many research products they've authored, and how much customization
      they want to do. As always, our
      <a href="http://feedback.impactstory.org/knowledgebase">knowledge base</a>
      is there to help anyone with questions.
      If your or anyone has any trouble, though,
      please don't hesitate to drop us an email at team@impactstory.org,
      and we'll get right back to you.
   </p>
   <p>
      Thanks again for your purchase. Your support helps keep Impactstory
      going as an independant, researcher-run nonprofit. We're so excited
      about how much we can accomplish together!
   </p>
   <p>
      All our best,<br> Heather Piwowar and Jason Priem (co-founders)
