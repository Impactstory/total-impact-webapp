        <h3>Import Articles from ORCID</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
        <p>Just enter your <a href="http://about.orcid.org/">ORCID ID</a> (for example, <em>0000-0001-5109-3700</em>).  We'll import the public <a href="http://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/118795">publication Works</a> associated with your ORCID record.</p>
        <p>If you don't have an ORCID ID yet, it only takes a few minutes to <a href="http://orcid.org/register">register for one</a> and automatically add your publications to it.</p>
        <p>ImpactStory only imports <strong>public</strong> publications.  If your Works are currently listed in your ORCID profile as "limited" or "private", you can change them to "public" on your <a href="http://orcid.org/works-update">ORCID Works update</a> page.</p>
        <p>We currently only import Works with dois â€” stay tuned, we'll support more work types soon!</p>
