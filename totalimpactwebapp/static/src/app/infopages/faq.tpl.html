   <h3 id="isitopen">Is this data Open?</h3>

   <p>The short answer: yes, as open as we can make make it.</p>

   <p>The longer answer is that, although we'd like to make all of the
      data displayed by Impactstory available under <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data">CC0</a>, the terms-of-use
      of most of the data sources don’t allow that. We're still working out the best ways to handle this.
      An option to restrict the displayed reports to Fully Open metrics — those suitable for commercial use — is on the To Do list.
   </p>
   <p>The Impactstory software itself is fully open source under an MIT license. <a href="https://github.com/total-impact">GitHub</a>


   <h3 id="can-i-keep-data">Do I get to keep my data if I unsubscribe?</h3>

   <p>For sure! Unlike most commercial sites for academics, we allow users full
      control over their data, including the ability to export everything in multiple formats (within the guidelines of our data providers; see above).
      You can <a href="http://feedback.impactstory.org/knowledgebase/articles/398552-exporting-your-impactstory-profile-data">export your data</a>&nbsp;at any time.</p>



   <h3 id="why-charge">Impactstory is a nonprofit. Why are you charging for profiles?</h3>

   <p>As a nonprofit, Impactstory doesn't do things like sell your personal data,  guard secret algorithms,
      cram your page with ads, or restrict access to data. That's because we're
      driven by a mission--to transform science evaluation--not by the need to
      impress investors or attract buyers. We're fiercely committed to independence, openness, and transparency;
      it's who we are, and it's not going to change.
   </p>

   <p>But we do have to keep the lights on. And although we've been generously supported
      by the NSF, JISC, and Sloan Foundation to date, we need a model that will keep us in the
      black in the coming years.
   </p>
   <p>
      Charging for individual profiles helps us stay laser-laser focused on delivering
      real, practical value to real scientists every day, and we like that. So far, so
      have our subscribers. We may also offer other plans (like department or lab subscriptions)
      in the future; if you've got thoughts on that, we'd love to hear from you.
   </p>


   <h3 id="multi-subscribe">Can I buy subscriptions for other people, like my lab or department?</h3>
   <p>
      Why yes. <a href="/buy-subscriptions">Yes you can.</a>
   </p>
