      <p>ImpactStory is an open-source, web-based tool that helps researchers explore and share the diverse impacts of all their research products&mdash;from traditional ones like journal articles, to emerging products like blog posts, datasets, and software. By helping researchers tell data-driven stories about their impacts, we're helping to build a new scholarly reward system that values and encourages web-native scholarship. We’re funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and incorporated as a nonprofit corporation.

      <p>ImpactStory delivers <em>open metrics</em>, with <em>context</em>, for <em>diverse products</em>:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>Open metrics</b>: Our data (to the extent allowed by providers’ terms of service), <a href="https://github.com/total-impact">code</a>, and <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/03/01/18535014681/">governance</a> are all open.</li>
         <li><b>With context</b>: To help researcher move from raw <a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</a> data to <a href="http://asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_Piwowar_Priem.html">impact profiles</a> that tell data-driven stories, we sort metrics by <em>engagement type</em> and <em>audience</em>. We also normalize based on comparison sets: an evaluator may not know if 5 forks on GitHub is a lot of attention, but they can understand immediately if their project ranked in the 95th percentile of all GitHub repos created that year.</li>
         <li><b>Diverse products</b>: Datasets, software, slides, and other research products are presented as an integrated section of a comprehensive impact report, alongside articles&mdash;each genre a first-class citizen, each making its own kind of impact.</li>
      </ul>

         <p><strong>Heather Piwowar</strong> is a cofounder of ImpactStory and a leading researcher in the area of research data availability and data reuse. She wrote one of the first papers to measure the <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308">citation benefit of publicly available research data</a> and has studied  <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018657">patterns in public deposition of datasets</a>, <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/1/">patterns of data reuse</a>, and the <a href="http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/journalpolicyproposal">impact of journal data sharing policies</a>.</p>

         <p>Heather has a bachelor’s and master’s degree from MIT in electrical engineering, 10 years of experience as a software engineer in small companies, and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics from the University of Pittsburgh.  She is an <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hpiwowar">frequent speaker</a> on research data archiving, writes a well-respected <a href="http://researchremix.wordpress.com">research blog</a>, and is active on twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/researchremix">@researchremix</a>). </p>

      <h3 id="history">history</h3>
      <p>ImpactStory began life as total-impact, a hackathon project at the Beyond Impact workshop in 2011. As the hackathon ended, a few of us migrated into a hotel hallway to continue working, eventually completing a 24-hour coding marathon to finish a prototype. Months of spare-time development followed, then funding.  We’ve got the same excitement for ImpactStory today.</p>

      <p>In early 2012, ImpactStory was given £17,000 through the <a href="http://beyond-impact.org/">Beyond Impact project</a> from the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Foundation</a>.  Today ImpactStory is funded by the <a href="http://sloan.org/">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>, first through <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/03/29/20131290500/">a $125,000 grant</a> in mid 2012 and then <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/2013/06/17/sloan/">a two-year grant for $500,000</a> starting in 2013.</p>
