{"abstract":"Google's PageRank has created a new synergy to information retrieval for a better ranking of Web pages. It ranks documents depending on the topology of the graphs and the weights of the nodes. PageRank has significantly advanced the field of information retrieval and keeps Google ahead of competitors in the search engine market. It has been deployed in bibliometrics to evaluate research impact, yet few of these studies focus on the important impact of the damping factor (d) for ranking purposes. This paper studies how varied damping factors in the PageRank algorithm can provide additional insight into the ranking of authors in an author co-citation network. Furthermore, we propose weighted PageRank algorithms. We select 108 most highly cited authors in the information retrieval (IR) area from the 1970s to 2008 to form the author co-citation network. We calculate the ranks of these 108 authors based on PageRank with damping factor ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. In order to test the relationship between these different measures, we compare PageRank and weighted PageRank results with the citation ranking, h-index, and centrality measures. We found that in our author co-citation network, citation rank is highly correlated with PageRank's with different damping factors and also with different PageRank algorithms; citation rank and PageRank are not significantly correlated with centrality measures; and h-index is not significantly correlated with centrality measures.","tags":["networks","citation","is","bibliometrics","citations","pagerank","as","academia","citation analysis","Emerging Trend Detection","authors","Folder - S701 - Session 16 - Webometrics, bibliome","BILL1","weighting","AUTHORSCO-citation couplingINFORMATION retrievalH-","ranking","Folder - citation&Ranking","co-citation networks"],"identifiers":{"oai_id":"oai:arXiv.org:1012.4872","arxiv":"1012.4872","issn":"1532-2882","isbn":"1532-2882","doi":"10.1002\/asi"},"website":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1012.4872","stats":{"readers":44,"discipline":[{"id":6,"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":68},{"id":23,"name":"Social Sciences","value":9},{"id":16,"name":"Management Science \/ Operations Research","value":5}],"country":[{"name":"United States","value":9},{"name":"Spain","value":5},{"name":"Switzerland","value":2}],"status":[{"name":"Ph.D. Student","value":27},{"name":"Student (Master)","value":14},{"name":"Associate Professor","value":14}]},"pages":"19","tags_counts":[1,3,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1],"type":"Journal Article","url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pagerank-ranking-authors-cocitation-networks\/","uuid":"310d8a0d-975f-3a23-96ef-189403ed112a","authors":[{"forename":"Ying","surname":"Ding"},{"forename":"Erjia","surname":"Yan"},{"forename":"Arthur","surname":"Frazho"},{"forename":"James","surname":"Caverlee"}],"mendeley_authors":{"4502157765":2832111},"title":"PageRank for ranking authors in co-citation networks","year":2010,"categories":[204,274,101,98,99,43,434,193,192,16,219,454,385,390,90],"mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pagerank-ranking-authors-cocitation-networks\/"}
